This project is a Hackernoon clone created using React

To start the project:
  -React needs to be installed
  -React-scroll should be installed to have the scrolling feature work ("npm install react-scroll" in terminal)
  -React tabs should be installed to have the tab feature work ("npm install --save react-tabs")
  -Enter "npm start" in terminal
  
Things I need to work on:
  -Organize files so that they are not all jumbled. Put javascript files in a file inside the 'src' folder called 'js' and etc
  -Footer and about section is not styled properly
